# Services

The `@blocklet/js-sdk` is organized into several service classes, each responsible for a specific domain of functionality. These services act as dedicated clients for different Blocklet API endpoints, providing a structured and intuitive way to interact with the platform's features.

Most core services are pre-initialized and available as properties on the main `BlockletSDK` instance, which you can obtain using the `getBlockletSDK()` function.

```javascript Accessing a Service icon=logos:javascript
import { getBlockletSDK } from '@blocklet/js-sdk';

const sdk = getBlockletSDK();

// Access the AuthService to get user info
async function getUserProfile() {
  const profile = await sdk.user.getProfile();
  console.log(profile);
}

// Access the BlockletService to get blocklet info
async function getBlockletMeta() {
  const meta = await sdk.blocklet.getMeta();
  console.log(meta);
}
```

The diagram below illustrates the structure of the `BlockletSDK` instance and its relationship with the core services.
